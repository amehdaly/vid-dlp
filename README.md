# vid-dlp KDE Downloader

A simple **YouTube and video downloader for Linux**, built with [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [`kdialog`](https://develop.kde.org/docs/administration/kdialog/).

This script provides a **graphical interface** for downloading videos from YouTube and other supported sites.  
It uses `kdialog` to prompt you for the **video URL** and the **destination folder**, then opens **Konsole** to show live download progress.

> **Note:** Your system does **not need to run KDE Plasma** to use this script.  
> `kdialog` can be installed and used on any Linux desktop (GNOME, XFCE, Cinnamon, etc.) as long as the required Qt and KDE libraries are present.
